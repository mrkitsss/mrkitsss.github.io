                    <h2>MRKITSSS is a producer and designer from SANTODOMINGO, ECUADOR, who has been interested in the world of art since he was very young. His first contact with this world was when he was a child and he began to paint black and white drawings that he printed from Google.</h2>
                    <h2>As he grew up, this passion that he had inside him did as well. In his adolescence Mrkitsss A.K.A Marcos Figueroa became interested in the world of freestyle, so he went to rap almost every weekend in a park near his house. At the same time, his desire to learn how to produce music continued to grow, however he did not It was not until the 2020 quarantine that he decided to learn how to produce professionally by watching tutorials on YouTube.</h2>
                    <h2>In 2021 he started selling the beats he made on YouTube, so he created a small community, over time he stopped uploading beats since it was not what he was really looking for, he wanted to work with big artists, he met MADBOYY A.K.A. Mateo León, with whom he forged a great friendship and together they began to send their tracks to international producers and singers.</h2>
